# BRC-721: Non-Fungible Tokens on the Bitcoin Network

BRC-721 is inspired by the BRC-20, an experimental standard for creating fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network. BRC-20, which can be found at [brc-20-experiment](https://domo-2.gitbook.io/brc-20-experiment), aims to bring the functionality of issuing tokens to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

By building upon the ideas and principles of BRC-20, BRC-721 extends the capabilities of tokenization on the Bitcoin network to include non-fungible tokens, thus enabling a broader range of digital asset management and value representation.

BRC-721 is designed for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Bitcoin network. It allows for the creation, ownership, and transfer of unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each token created under BRC-721 has a unique identifier, making them distinct and non-interchangeable.
